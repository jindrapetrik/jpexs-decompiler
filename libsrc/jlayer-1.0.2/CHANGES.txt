11/16/2008: JLayer 1.0.1
------------------------
- Subband allocation bug fix.


11/28/2004: JLayer 1.0
----------------------
- VBRI frame header (Fraunhofer VBR) support added in Header.java.
- Frame controls improved. It fixes the following bugs :
    + ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception in t_43[] array.
    + ArrayIndexOutOfBound Exception in huffman_decode() method.
- Licensing moved from GPL to LGPL : It means that you can use JLayer in
  your own application without being restricted by GPL license issues.
  It's more business friendly.
- JavaLayer renamed into JLayer to be compliant to SUN trademark rules.
- Tested under JRE 1.5.0. CPU usage < 1%, RAM usage < 12MB under P4/2Ghz.


01/02/2004: JavaLayer 0.4
-------------------------
- XING VBR header frame support improved in Header.java :
    + public boolean vbr() added.
    + public int vbr_scale() added.
    + public byte[] vbr_toc() added.
    total_ms(), ms_per_frame(), min_number_of_frames(int), max_number_of_frames(int),
    bitrate_string(), bitrate() methods check for VBR status.

- ID3v2 frames support improved :
    + public InputStream getRawID3v2() added in Bitstream.java

- Misc : 
    Bug fixed in the decoder for some +320kbps stream.
    Bug fixed : SYNC conflict with some ID3v2 frames.
    + public int bitrate() added.
    + public int bitrate_instant() added.
    jUnit tests added (see srctest/ folder)


08/04/2003: JavaLayer 0.3.0
---------------------------
- Advanced threaded player classes added.


04/01/2002: JavaLayer 0.2.0
---------------------------
 - MPEG 2.5 support added.
   Encoded files with LAME are supported.
 - Bug fixes for ms time computation with free format.
 + Bench notes :
    + Heap use range : 1380KB to 1900KB - 370 classes loaded. 
    + Footprint : ~8MB under WinNT4 + J2SE 1.3 (Hotspot).
    + CPU usage : ~12% under PIII 800Mhz/WinNT4+J2SE 1.3 (Hotspot).
    + CPU usage : ~11% under PIII 1Ghz/Win2K+J2SE 1.4 (Hotspot).


03/04/2002: JavaLayer 0.1.2
---------------------------
 - API improved to let developers get MP3 bitrate, framelength and total time features.
 - Additionnal files added (CHANGES.txt and LICENSE.txt).


10/01/2001: JavaLayer 0.1.1
---------------------------
 - Bugs fixes in the decoder (Layer III).


07/02/2001: JavaLayer 0.1.0
---------------------------
 - Streaming support added to the simple player (jlp). 
 - Bugs fixes in the simple player (too fast playback for low rate files).


06/04/2001: JavaLayer 0.0.9
---------------------------
 - Bugs fixes in Layer I and Layer II decoder. 
 - ANT build script added.
 - HTML page added to play MP3 through PlayerApplet in a JavaSound 1.0 (JDK 1.3) 
   compliant browser.


04/16/2000: JavaLayer 0.0.8 
---------------------------
A simple player have been added and you can now play MP3 in real time with JVM 
that supports JavaSound 1.0 (i.e JDK 1.3). 

 - Bug fixes. 
 - Decoder improvements. 
 - Build Scripts have been added for Win32 and Unix platforms. 


12/16/1999: JavaLayer 0.0.7 
---------------------------
JavaLayer 0.0.7 contains significant improvements over version 0.0 :

 - API and documentation added.
 - The decoder is much more faster. Fast enough for real-time decoding.
 - Huffman/Layer3 tables serialization added. 
 - New buffers management. 
 - Exceptions + Utils added. 
 - Bugs fixes.


02/28/1999: JavaLayer 0.0
-------------------------
JavaLayer V0.0 does not play any MP3 but it allows the MP3toWAV conversion.
This is the first step in this project. We do it thanks to free mp3 ressources 
available on the net:

 - MAPlay for the OO MP3 decoder (C++).
 - WAV format description from Microsoft. 

The MP3 decoder works now but it is too slow to allow real time implementation.
