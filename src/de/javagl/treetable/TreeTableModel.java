 * TreeTableModel is the model used by a JTreeTable. It extends TreeModel
 * to add methods for getting information about the set of columns each 
 * node in the TreeTableModel may have. Each column, like a column in 
 * a TableModel, has a name and a type associated with it. Each node in 
 * the TreeTableModel can return a value for each of the columns and 
 * set that value if isCellEditable() returns true. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Note:</b> In order to actually display the JTree in one column of the 
 * JTreeTable, implementors of this class have to return the 
 * <code>TreeTableModel.class</code> as the respective column class
 * in their implementation of the {@link #getColumnClass(int)} method:
 * <pre><code>
 * public Class&lt;?&gt; getColumnClass(int column)
 * {
 *     if (column == columnThatShouldContainTheTree)
 *     {
 *         return TreeTableModel.class;
 *     }
 *     // Return other types as desired:
 *     return Object.class;
 * }
